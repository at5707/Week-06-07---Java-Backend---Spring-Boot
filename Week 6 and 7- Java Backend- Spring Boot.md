Overview 

The sixth and seventh weeks were dedicated to understanding the concepts of Java Backend in the Java programming language, specifically the spring boot concept. We covered the concepts related to Tomcat Servlet, along with an introduction to Spring Boot. We also learnt the concept of Spring REST API Calls and Request Handing, along with it also learning about spring framework and multi-layer development with H2 DB.

Topics Covered

Day 1: Tomcat Servlet

Here you will learn how to create a Java Web Server to understand the complexity of Web Server. Then you will be introduced to Tomcat as Web Server. Further you will go to develop a simple application using Servlet.

Day 2: Spring Intro

Here you will learn to develop a Simple Hello World App to begin with. Further we will deep dive into Spring Core Framework to get understanding of how Spring Framework works underneath using - Spring Annotations, IoC, Dependency Injections, etc.

Day 3: Spring REST API Calls and Request Handling

Here you will develop a Single Controller supporting multiple HTTP Methods and start a Greetings App. You will be asked to test the REST Calls using CURL from the Terminal. Then you will go to start the development of Simple Messaging App.

Day 4: Spring Framework and Multi-Layer Development with H2 DB

Here you will learn more about Spring Framework and inherent multi-layered architecture of Spring. You will also develop the My Greeting App using H2 DB
